# Face-Detection-Based-Student-Attendance-System
This is the system i created for my final year project of college.
In this Attendance System the attendance for students is marked using Face verification. The Faculty has the permission to take Attendance, add a student, modify student details. The Faculty can also search for attendance of a student and view overall attendance report of all students.
The credentials for the Faculty are provided by the superuser who has access to the whole database.
"Django" web framework was used for the development of the whole web application. OpenCv and face_recognition API's were used for the development of Face Recognizer.
Python 3.9.6 was used for this project.
To run this web app on your computer, create a virtual environment and install the required libraries which are listed in file (requirements.txt) using the command: pip install -r requirements.txt.
After successfully installing all required libraries, run the following command to open web application: python manage.py runserver.
